## Common Questions

### How do I set up a hitmarker sound?

Establish a folder called "hitsounds" in the primary directory of Counter-Strike Global Offensive. You can add any number of .wav sound files to this folder. When the hack is activated, these hitmarker sounds will be selectable via the hitsounds dropdown menu.

### Where are the config files stored?

Configuration files are stored within a directory called "profiles" located in the main Counter-Strike Global Offensive directory.

To share profiles, go to the cheat's configuration menu and choose Export. This action transfers all the configuration details to your clipboard, allowing you to pass it along to others.

To add a profile, paste the configuration data and press Import. Ensure to save your profile by naming it and clicking Save.
